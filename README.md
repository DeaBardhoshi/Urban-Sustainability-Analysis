# Urban-Sustainability-Analysis

This project serves as a tool that allows cities to analyse their sustainability based on transportation accessibility, green spaces and allocation of funds built using OSMnx, GeoPandas and Pandas. The second file in this repository focuses on building k-Means clustering to predict the optimal locations for bike stations in Tirana, Albania using sklearn, Folium and Pandas.
